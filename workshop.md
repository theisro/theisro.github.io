# Workshops

{:.highlight-green}
The ISRO values the sharing and dissemination of ideas through an open source model. We run workshops for adults and children that explore concepts of sound, electronics, programming and physics. We design educational kits for public distribution to emphasise the value of hands on making. Our projects and programs are fundamentally rooted in the facilitation of workshops, mentorships, apprenticeships and other educational activities.

# Upcoming Workshop

Yati Durant - July 30th - August 3rd

Yati will be working with the [Indian Sonic Research Organisation](https://www.theisro.org/) and students of [ArtScienceBLR](https://artscienceblr.org) in Bangalore, India from 29th July - 2nd August 2019. The project will involved using collaborative concepts from the [Saundaryalahari Project](http://www.saundaryalahari.eca.ed.ac.uk) to develop art and music works that involve technology and creativity and consider ways in which they can be performed and/or installed in India. The Saundaryalahari project uses “proto-linguistic” practices to work in creative fields together. It will be exciting to see this project develop and outcomes will be posted on this website and otherwise! [Read more]({% post_url 2019-07-15-yati-durant-workshop-performances %})
