The Indian Sonic Research Institute is proud to host the artist duo STRWÜÜ (Jo Wanneng & Lukas Fütterer). The duo was established in 2014.

Since then ,they have kidnapped plants, eaten it for a stop-motion animation and performed together with a giant water lily in a pond. They had inaudible sound objects concealed, used each other as marionettes and spent a long time to move a small stick slowly forward. They arranged animals into ever-changing patterns, provided old printers with prosthesis and made Chinese pigeon whistles circle in a huge hall. They tied strings to shape sounds, let insects rain and constructed a noise as unstable as possible. They bridged time to create space, occupied industrial buildings while oscillating and forced air to dance. They deprived fans of their cooling effect, cooked rosin to generate friction and sank a mycelium in dirges.

The residency is generously supported by the Goethe-Institute, Bangalore. [www.strwueue.de](http://www.strwueue.de).
