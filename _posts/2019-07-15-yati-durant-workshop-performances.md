Yati Durant is a U.S. born composer, lecturer, trumpeter and conductor currently based in the UK. After receiving a commission from The Juilliard School for his string symphony The Ship, he began studies in composition at the State Conservatory of Music in Cologne, Germany with Polish composer Krzysztof Meyer.  Yati holds several diplomas under Krzysztof Meyer, as well as an Electronic Composition diploma under Hans Ulrich Humpert.  His critically acclaimed new score to Sergei Eisenstein’s 1925 silent film The Battleship Potemkin earned him a prestigious first Meisterklasse Konzertexam in 2006.  He has also studied with George Crumb, Philip Lasser, Narcis Bonet, Lee Konitz and conducting with Jonathan Brett.


Since 2010, Yati is Lecturer of Music, Sound and Moving Image at the Reid School of Music, University of Edinburgh and Music Director of the Edinburgh Film Music Orchestra.  He is Director of the European Education Alliance for Music and Sound in Media (EEAMS) at Soundtrack Cologne. He is frequently invited to hold lectures, symposia, masterclasses and workshops in composition, composition for screen, improvisation and performance at major Conservatories and Universities across Europe, India and China.


Yati will introduce participants to techniques first developed by the 8th century Indian philosopher Shankaracharya to develop ‘porto-linguistic’ practices that have their roots in pre-verbal, non-textual geometry.
These practices will help creative practitioners from diverse disciplines (architecture, design, dance and music) to collaborate, create and produce pieces of work across fields.
