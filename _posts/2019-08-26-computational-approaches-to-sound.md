CSOUND is a powerful and versatile software synthesis program. Drawing from a toolkit of over 450 signal processing modules, one can use CSound to model virtually any commercial synthesizer or multi-effect processor. CSound transforms a personal computer into a high end digital audio workstation- an environment in which the world of composition, acoustic research and sound-design all join together in the ultimate expressive instrument. The 2 week workshop will cover various compositional techniques with CSound. No previous knowledge of programming or music composition is necessary.
