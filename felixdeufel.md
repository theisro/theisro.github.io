# Felix Deufel

Felix Deufel studied Digital Media Sound at the University of Applied Science Darmstadt and
graduated with a BA in 2012 with his media installation Panopticum der Postmoderne. In 2015, he
earned his MA in Leadership in the Creative Industries with the collaborative project, Clink, an
interactive, 3D audiovisual environment. During his studies Felix worked as a Beta Tester for the 3D
Audio System Spatial Sound Wave (SSW) at the Fraunhofer IDMT and participated with prize-winning
projects in Fulldome Festivals. Ever since, he works intensively with 3D Audio as format and medium
for different purposes.

In 2012 he founded the artist collective Ciao Kakao in Darmstadt and club and venue tour with the
interactive light installation Alienature, 2013/14 artist-in-residence at House of Natural Fiber (HONF)
in Yogyakarta, Indonesia â€“ projects, among others: Laszlo ambient/noise performances, Acrobotics,
interactive bio hacking exhibition in collaboration with HONF in Jakarta, and Im Walde, interactive,
audiovisual installation at Proto:type Y2014, Yogyakarta.
Since 2013 Felix has been in collaboration with Paul Schengber as Wisp Kollektiv. Their first work was
ClinK, where interactive behaviours of spectators, in respect of 3D audio and 3D visual surroundings
were explored and tested. The installation was among others shown on Node Forum for Digital Arts
2015 in Frankfurt and on Wisp Microfestival for Digital Arts in Leipzig.

In 2016, Felix and Paul Schengber founded the Wisp Festival for Arts, Technology and
Communication in Leipzig. The leitmotiv The stranger within us is based on Arno Gruen`s lecture
about the loss of empathy in society. This subject was addressed and interpreted in several
workshops, lectures, performances, concerts and an exhibition by more than 70 international artists.
