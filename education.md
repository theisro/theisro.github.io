# Education
The ISRO values the sharing and dissemination of ideas through an open source model. We run workshops for adults and children that explore concepts of sound, electronics, programming and physics. We design educational kits for public distribution to emphasise the value of hands on making. Our projects and programs are fundamentally rooted in the facilitation of workshops, mentorships, apprenticeships and other educational activities.
