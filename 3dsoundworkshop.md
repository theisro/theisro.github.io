# Composing and performing with 3D sound

## Workshop Introduction

The 5 day workshop contains a gentle introduction, hands-on exercises and gives time for individuals or groups to compose and create pieces of music/sound art with a 32 channel 3 D Sound System. 3D audio is a technology for reproduction of audio in space, adding the vertical dimension and higher resolution to usual surround sound. The natural dynamics of sound in space can be imitated and immersive life-like listening experiences can be created.

The workshop is open to artists interested in performance, composition, installation and the technical aspects of immersive and spatial audio. The projects will be performed at the final public concert on 29 of October (location TBA). The workshop is ideal for musicians, DJs, composers, theatre directors, producers, artists, audio engineers and programmers. No previous knowledge in 3D audio required.
