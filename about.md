The Indian Sonic Research Organisation is a Bangalore based collective of instrument builders and artists dedicated to the proliferation of experimental music and sound art. 

We run an open community sound studio in Bangalore where we build instruments, learn and collaborate through workshops, performances and artist residencies. 

Our studio is always open to the public. You are welcome to drop by our studio to build instruments, record, work on your sound or just hang out. To find out more about the studio, please visit the studio page.

The studio also hosts regular workshops. If you would like to participate in our workshops, please subscribe to our mailing list and visit the workshop page for more information. Our workshops are beginner friendly and range from practical instrument building and D.I.Y electronics to more process based workshops such as deep listening and introduction to sound art.

For sound artists and experimental musicians, we offer 4 residencies every year. The artist residencies are open to international artists as well. We offer accommodation, studio spaces and help with funding for travel and realization of projects. Please visit this page for more information about the residency.

Our YOUTUBE channel has videos of performances, instruments and workshops:

In addition to workshops in our studio, we also organise a series of ‘FIELD TRIPS’--expeditions to wild and remote places with an intent to listen and to gather sounds. More about FIELD TRIPS here


THE ISRO STUDIO

Along with a variety of quirky, rare instruments, the ISRO studio also hosts the first 32 channel 3Daudio system in India. The studio is open to use for members of the community and is an ideal space for artists and composers interested in exploring multichannel, surround sound and ambisonic sound. 

The instruments at the ISRO studio range from modular synthesisers and Theremins to traditional Indian instruments. The 3D sound system and various instruments are built and maintained by the artists in residence at the ISRO. For more information on the studio, please visit this page.

The studio is also a live venue for performances by some of the most refreshing and visionary musicians and sound artists. You can view their recorded performances here:[/cave.html]

WORKSHOPS


<Image of workshop>

“Liberating education consists in acts of cognition, not transferals of information.”
― Paulo Freire

We share and disseminate our ideas through open workshops. We run workshops for musicians, composers and even children that explore concepts of sound, electronics, programming and physics. The workshops along with the educational kits that we habe designed, emphasise the value of hands on making. Our projects and programs are fundamentally rooted in the facilitation of workshops, mentorships and apprentice programs.

Some examples of workshops: 
	
circuit bending, 

instrument building,

electronics for musicians 

composing with 3D sounds.
